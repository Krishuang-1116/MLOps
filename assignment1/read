api.py (or main.py): only handles HTTP things
* routes (@app.get, @app.post, etc.)
* request/response models (Pydantic)
* calling your “business logic” (the scoring function)

scoring.py (or model.py): contains the “scoring algorithm” function
* for now it can return a placeholder value (or be empty but importable)
* later it will implement house-price prediction/scoring

This is a standard pattern in MLOps: separate serving layer (API) from ML logic.
